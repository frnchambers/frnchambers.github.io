  <h1>Frank Chambers</h1>
  <p>I was theoretical physics student in TCD from 2011-2015. I moved to Amsterdam to complete a PhD studying Type I X-ray burst between 2015-2019 which transitioned into a post-doc. I am now a visiting scientist at the University of Amsterdam. You can read a bit more about my scientific career at my <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/f.r.n.chambers/">website</a>.
